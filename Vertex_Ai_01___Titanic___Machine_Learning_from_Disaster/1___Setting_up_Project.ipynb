    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Click `Create Project`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the `New Project` window that appears, enter a project name and select a billing account as applicable. A project name can contain only letters, numbers, single quotes, hyphens, spaces, or exclamation points, and must be between 4 and 30 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Enter the parent organization or folder resource in the `Location` box. That resource will be the hierarchical parent of the new project. If `No organization` is an option, you can select it to create your new project as the top level of its own resource hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. When you're finished entering new project details, click `Create`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can find your `Project` under `Resources` within your assigned `Organization`.\n",
